  "summary": "The sales representative, Bruce Wayne, initiated a follow-up on a Marketing Cloud Lite proposal. The prospect, Emily Johnson, consistently expressed strong objections regarding high pricing, value, comparisons to competitors, strict budget limitations (under $90K), and a demand for immediate, out-of-the-box functionality, rejecting options for phased rollouts. Despite Bruce's responsive attempts to address these concerns by offering detailed breakdowns, pricing flexibility, and committing to a rapid deployment proposal revision, Emily ultimately decided to pause the discussion, stating she would only re-engage if her leadership remained interested. The deal is currently stalled due to unaddressed pricing/budget and timeline objections.",
