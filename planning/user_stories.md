## Problem Statement

In fast-moving sales environments, reps often miss follow-ups, let deals go cold, or forget to update CRM fieldsâ€”not because Salesforce is lacking, but because human workflows are fragmented and time-constrained. Sales reps need a smart, AI-powered dashboard that brings together CRM data, communication history, and third-party insights to enhance their existing workflows. Our target audience is sales teams at B2B companies currently using Salesforce.

## User Roles

Sales Representative: A user directly managing sales deals and interacting with prospects.

Sales Manager: A user overseeing a team of sales representatives and analyzing pipeline performance.

## User Personas

User Role: Sales Representative
Alex: Alex is a 32-year-old Senior Account Executive based in San Francisco, CA. Alex is driven by data and wants GoatForce to provide deeper, proactive insights into his pipeline, reducing time spent on manual CRM updates so he can focus on strategic selling. His pain points include missing subtle cues in email exchanges, feeling overwhelmed by the volume of deals, and wanting to quickly understand why a deal has stalled without extensive digging.

Sarah: Sarah is a 25-year-old Business Development Representative working remotely from Austin, TX. She's newer to sales and sometimes struggles with consistent follow-up and crafting compelling messages. Sarah wants GoatForce to give her timely reminders and suggested actions to keep her deals moving forward, and to learn how to effectively communicate with different types of prospects. Her pain points include forgetting to log activities in Salesforce, struggling to personalize outreach at scale, and feeling unsure about how to revive "cold" leads.

User Role: Sales Manager
David: David is a 45-year-old Sales Director based in Chicago, IL, managing a team of 10 reps. He prioritizes high-level over granular details. David wants GoatForce to give him a clear, digestible overview of his team's pipeline health, identify at-risk deals before they become problems, and understand overall team performance trends. His pain points include spending too much time aggregating data from various sources, lacking a quick way to identify which reps need support on specific deals, and struggling to forecast accurately due to incomplete CRM data.

Maria: Maria is a 38-year-old Sales Team Lead working out of Boston, MA. She's hands-on with her team of 5 reps, often collaborating directly on deals. Maria wants GoatForce to help her quickly identify deals where her reps might need help, provide targeted coaching based on communication patterns, and ensure her team maintains high CRM hygiene. Her pain points include not having immediate visibility into stalled deals, struggling to give personalized feedback to reps on their follow-up strategies, and spending time manually auditing CRM entries for accuracy.
