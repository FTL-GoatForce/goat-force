  "summary": "The conversation initiated with David expressing challenges with siloed legacy tools. Bruce offered a tailored Loom demo, which David initially liked but indicated a lengthy evaluation timeline and a need for IT review. After a significant period of inactivity, David abruptly notified Bruce that the deal was lost due to negative feedback from their IT team regarding the demo and their decision to proceed with a competitor. Bruce acknowledged the loss professionally.",
