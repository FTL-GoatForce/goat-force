The sales rep, Bruce, provided a loom demo, which David initially found solid, indicating an August timeline for vendor evaluation. However, after a significant period of inactivity, David informed Bruce that the deal was lost because an internal stakeholder deemed the demo unimpressive, and they decided to proceed with a competitor.",
