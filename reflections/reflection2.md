#### Name at least one successful thing this week.
* We were able to successfully get auth, so now we can cater to multiple users.
#### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
- We faced difficulties with our auth, we worked with google auth and that was a bit tricky to handle but we got it done.
#### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
- We wanted to pivot from slack mcp to our own api but we faced other challenges before we got to it. So we werent able to get to it 
#### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
- We did find some resources helpful, like the google docs gemini docs along with the gmail auth docs.
#### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
- The only feature that is at risk is sending slack message directly from the app, that will only work if we do pivot to slack api.
