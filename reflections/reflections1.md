**Name at least one successful thing this week:**

Successfully implemented the data fetching and state management for the Sandbox component, including proper loading states with skeleton screens and dynamic deal selection. The component now correctly handles API responses and updates the UI seamlessly when users select different deals. Also completed the dynamically displayed data for the front end.

**What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week:**

- Data structure complexity: The JSON responses had inconsistent nesting (some had event.event paths while others had direct event paths), which required implementing flexible data parsing logic
- State management timing: Coordinating when to set loading states and ensuring components didn't render before data was available
- Component communication: Passing the correct data structure between parent and child components, especially with the nested personality traits data

**Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week:**

Yes, we completed all planned tasks including:

- Dynamic data rendering for dashboard components / pages
- GET request implementation for deals, participants, and communication data
- Data schema finalization
- MCP integration for Slack and Gmail data ingestion
- Loading states and error handling for all API calls

**Did the resources provided help prepare you for planning and executing your sprint:**

Yes, particularly helpful were:

- React documentation: Essential for understanding useEffect dependencies and state management patterns
- API testing tools: Helped identify the data structure inconsistencies early
- Component library docs (MUI): Made implementing consistent loading states much faster

**Areas needing more support:**

- Advanced state management for complex data flows
- Performance optimization for large datasets, gmail MCP optimization as well

**Which user stories would you consider "at risk":**

- Story #9 (Automated CRM field suggestions): This requires natural language processing of email content to extract structured data, which may be technically challenging within our timeline

**How will you change your plan if those items remain "at risk":**

- Automated CRM suggestions: Focus on manual field completion with smart defaults, then add automation as a stretch feature
- Prioritization shift: Ensure core dashboard functionality and the other user stories are rock-solid before implementing advanced AI features
