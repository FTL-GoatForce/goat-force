  "summary": "The sales thread between Bruce Wayne (rep) and Emily Johnson (prospect) centers on the Marketing Cloud Lite proposal. Emily consistently raises strong objections regarding pricing, value, and budget, setting a firm limit of under $90K and rejecting complex rollouts in favor of an out-of-the-box solution. Bruce attempts to address these concerns by offering to revise the proposal for rapid deployment and cost adjustment. However, the conversation ultimately stalls, with Emily deciding to pause discussions and only circle back if her leadership shows renewed interest.",
