  "summary": "The sales representative Bruce Wayne followed up on a proposal for Marketing Cloud Lite. The prospect, Emily Johnson, raised several objections including high price, competitive offerings, strict budget limits ($90K), and a need for out-of-the-box functionality without a long rollout. Bruce committed to revising the proposal to address these points, but Emily decided to pause the discussion, stating she would circle back if leadership was still interested.",
