  "AI_GENERATED_SUMMARY": "The sales representative, Bruce Wayne, followed up on a proposal for Marketing Cloud Lite. The prospect, Emily Johnson, consistently raised objections regarding high pricing, competitive comparisons, a strict budget limit of $90K, and the demand for immediate, out-of-the-box functionality. Despite Bruce's efforts to address these concerns by offering proposal revisions for rapid deployment and price adjustments, Emily ultimately decided to pause the discussion, indicating she would only re-engage if her leadership expressed renewed interest.",

  "RECOMMENDATIONS": {
    "Next_Steps": ["Revise the proposal focusing on rapid deployment", "Send a detailed breakdown of features and pricing", "Schedule a follow-up call if leadership shows interest"],
    "Escalation_Triggers": "If no response is received in two weeks, consider escalating to higher management.",
    "Deal_Acceleration_Tactics": "Offer a limited-time discount or additional features to incentivize the prospect."
