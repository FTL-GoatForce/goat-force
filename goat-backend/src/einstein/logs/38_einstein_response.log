  "AI_GENERATED_SUMMARY": "The sales representative, Bruce Wayne, followed up on a proposal for Marketing Cloud Lite. The prospect, Emily Johnson, consistently raised objections regarding high pricing, competitive comparisons, a strict budget limit of $90K, and the demand for immediate, out-of-the-box functionality. Despite Bruce's efforts to address these concerns by offering proposal revisions for rapid deployment and price adjustments, Emily ultimately decided to pause the discussion, indicating she would only re-engage if her leadership expressed renewed interest.",
